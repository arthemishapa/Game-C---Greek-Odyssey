                Welcome, traveler, to a 
                different kind of story!

"Greek Odyssey" is a brief adventure that will plunge you into one of the many forgotten greek myths that were never portrayed in literature.

This unknown tale follows Artemis, the chaste goddess of the hunt, in her great mission of rescuing Zeus. In a moment of vulnerability and great luck, a few Titans, alongside Themis, had succeeded in stealing Zeus' thunderbolt, thus they had power over him. Fortunately, this deed was not left unseen, for Cerynitis, the sacred deer to Artemis, had caught a glimpse of the Titans' minions running away with the thunderbolt. Consequently, Cerynitis rushed to his goddess who was...sleeping on the moon.
